    <h1>Eternal Format Ban List</h1>

    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      The goal of this document is to create a copy of the Pokemon TCG Eternal Format ban list
      that includes explanations for why each card is banned. Many cards that are banned in the format
      are understandably not seen as overwhelmingly strong to someone trying out the format for the first time,
      given that the setup for a game-breaking combo often uses old and obscure cards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even after personally playing the format for quite a while now, there are bans included on this list that I was
      unfamiliar with and/or had to discuss with veterans of the format about the specifics of how to break them.
      The beauty of this format comes from the creativity of deck building and complex interactions that cards from
      entirely different eras can have, but with that complexity there is often confusion as well. I think it would be
      extremely beneficial to have a reference to fall back on when discussing the specifics of any individual ban.
    </p>
    <p>
      When discussing bans in this format, it is important to keep in mind what the purpose of this format is.
      While I am not in a place to say officially what that is, my understanding is that the format is meant to
      replicate the pacing and feeling of gameplay that many standard formats previously have had, while allowing
      players to use as much of the TCG's card pool as possible. The aim seems to be to create a meta that maximizes
      diversity and playability of as many archetypes as possible. There is a balance there between allowing strong
      decks to be strong, while also not allowing any one deck to be too strong. Another primary goal is to simply have
      a good time and ensure that potential decks which don't allow for this don't see play. This is a difficult
      balance to manage, but we try our best.

    <h1>Banned Cards</h1>

    <h2>Oppressive Lock</h2>
    <p>
      The cards included in this section are all characterized by being able to consistently lock a player out of key 
      parts of the game, dramatically warping gameplay. Some forms of lock are a normal and healthy part of the game, 
      but these ones in particular have been deemed too overwhelming and unenjoyable to be healthy for the format
    </p>
    <h3>Evolution Lock</h3>
    <p>
      The ability to completely prevent the play of evolution cards is an auto-win into many evolving decks, 
      drastically warping the format and discouraging the play of a substantial amount of cards in the card pool.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is worth noting that both Banette and Bronzong can be brought into play on turn 1 due to Banette's 
      Delta Evolution and a Bronzor with the Adaptive Evolution Ability.
