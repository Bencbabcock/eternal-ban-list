    <h1>Eternal Format Ban List</h1>

    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      The goal of this document is to create a copy of the Pokemon TCG Eternal Format ban list
      that includes explanations for why each card is banned. Many cards that are banned in the format
      are understandably not seen as overwhelmingly strong to someone trying out the format for the first time,
      given that the setup for a game-breaking combo often uses old and obscure cards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even after personally playing the format for quite a while now, there are bans included on this list that I was
      unfamiliar with and/or had to discuss with veterans of the format about the specifics of how to break them.
      The beauty of this format comes from the creativity of deck building and complex interactions that cards from
      entirely different eras can have, but with that complexity there is often confusion as well. I think it would be
      extremely beneficial to have a reference to fall back on when discussing the specifics of any individual ban.
    </p>
    <p>
      When discussing bans in this format, it is important to keep in mind what the purpose of this format is.
      While I am not in a place to say officially what that is, my understanding is that the format is meant to
      replicate the pacing and feeling of gameplay that many standard formats previously have had, while allowing
      players to use as much of the TCG's card pool as possible. The aim seems to be to create a meta that maximizes
      diversity and playability of as many archetypes as possible. There is a balance there between allowing strong
      decks to be strong, while also not allowing any one deck to be too strong. Another primary goal is to simply have
      a good time and ensure that potential decks which don't allow for this don't see play. This is a difficult
      balance to manage, but we try our best.
    </p>

    <h1>Banned Cards</h1>

    <h2 id="oppressive-lock">Oppressive Lock</h2>
    <p>
      The cards included in this section are all characterized by being able to consistently lock a player out of key 
      parts of the game, dramatically warping gameplay. Some forms of lock are a normal and healthy part of the game, 
      but these ones in particular have been deemed too overwhelming and unenjoyable to be healthy for the format
    </p>
    <h3 id="evolution-lock">Evolution Lock</h3>
    <p>
      The ability to completely prevent the play of evolution cards is an auto-win into many evolving decks, 
      drastically warping the format and discouraging the play of a substantial amount of cards in the card pool.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is worth noting that both Banette and Bronzong can be brought into play on turn 1 due to Banette's 
      Delta Evolution and a Bronzor with the Adaptive Evolution Ability.

    <h3 id="trainer-lock">Trainer Lock</h3>

    <p>
      Trainers have come to make up the majority of modern decks. Cards that then lock a player out of playing 
      that majority of cards tend to be incredibly strong.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some cards in this category lock a player out of playing Trainer cards as a whole, while a few only lock 
      items. There are versions of both of these effects which are not banned in eternal (primarily the latter), 
      but these ones are easier to pull off than those that remain legal.

          The following cards require a coin flip to pull off the trainer lock, but this drawback can be easily 
          remedied completely with Will CEC 208 or, to some extent, with Victini NVI 14

          Seismitoad-EX and Vikavolt V lock only items with an effect of an attack. This is relatively common 
          and accepted to be a healthy part of the game. The issue with these is that they are big basics, making 
          them extremely difficult to KO if they are item locking you as soon as turn 2. With little to no 
          opportunity to get set up, taking out a big basic can be an impossible task

          The drawback of Walrein CEC lies both in the fact that the card is a stage 2 as well as the fact that 
          Cold Snap is not able to be used on consecutive turns. Both of these can be side-stepped by using 
          attacks that copy the effect of Cold Snap, such as the one on Slowking SCR. This way the attack being 
          used is the copying attack (Seek Inspiration in this example) and not Cold Snap.

          Houndoom UF started out as legal until eventually being banned in August 2023. Passive Trainer lock 
          (excluding supporters) was eventually found to simply be too strong of an effect for a Stage 1, even 
          with the caveats that Houndoom has. It saw particularly scary results in Banette ex.

          Gengar & Mimikyu-GX is slightly different than the rest of the cards in this category since it's 
          locking attack can only be used once per game. It is not banned only for this attack, but also for being 
          a high hp basic and having a very strong Poltergeist attack as well. Due to being a basic, this card 
          simply allows a player to pull too far ahead too quickly.

          Hex maniac being a supporter allows for use and reuse on demand with things like VS Seeker, 
          unlike the unbanned Goop Gas Attack. Muk FO, unlike Garbodor DRX, has little to no counter play. Where 
          Windstorm or Faba are common Garbodor counters, there are no such common counters for Muk.
