    <h1>Eternal Format Ban List</h1>

    <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
    <p>
      The goal of this document is to create a copy of the Pokemon TCG Eternal Format ban list
      that includes explanations for why each card is banned. Many cards that are banned in the format
      are understandably not seen as overwhelmingly strong to someone trying out the format for the first time,
      given that the setup for a game-breaking combo often uses old and obscure cards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even after personally playing the format for quite a while now, there are bans included on this list that I was
      unfamiliar with and/or had to discuss with veterans of the format about the specifics of how to break them.
      The beauty of this format comes from the creativity of deck building and complex interactions that cards from
      entirely different eras can have, but with that complexity there is often confusion as well. I think it would be
      extremely beneficial to have a reference to fall back on when discussing the specifics of any individual ban.
    </p>
    <p>
      When discussing bans in this format, it is important to keep in mind what the purpose of this format is.
      While I am not in a place to say officially what that is, my understanding is that the format is meant to
      replicate the pacing and feeling of gameplay that many standard formats previously have had, while allowing
      players to use as much of the TCG's card pool as possible. The aim seems to be to create a meta that maximizes
      diversity and playability of as many archetypes as possible. There is a balance there between allowing strong
      decks to be strong, while also not allowing any one deck to be too strong. Another primary goal is to simply have
      a good time and ensure that potential decks which don't allow for this don't see play. This is a difficult
      balance to manage, but we try our best.

    <h1>Banned Cards</h1>

    <h2 id="oppressive-lock">Oppressive Lock</h2>
    <p>
      The cards included in this section are all characterized by being able to consistently lock a player out of key 
      parts of the game, dramatically warping gameplay. Some forms of lock are a normal and healthy part of the game, 
      but these ones in particular have been deemed too overwhelming and unenjoyable to be healthy for the format
    </p>
    <h3 id="evolution-lock">Evolution Lock</h3>
    <p>
      The ability to completely prevent the play of evolution cards is an auto-win into many evolving decks, 
      drastically warping the format and discouraging the play of a substantial amount of cards in the card pool.
    </p>
    <p>
      It is worth noting that both Banette and Bronzong can be brought into play on turn 1 due to Banette's 
      Delta Evolution and a Bronzor with the Adaptive Evolution Ability.

    <h3 id="trainer-lock">Trainer Lock</h3>

    <p>
      Trainers have come to make up the majority of modern decks. Cards that then lock a player out of playing 
      that majority of cards tend to be incredibly strong.
    </p>
    <p>
      Some cards in this category lock a player out of playing Trainer cards as a whole, while a few only lock 
      items. There are versions of both of these effects which are not banned in eternal (primarily the latter), 
      but these ones are easier to pull off than those that remain legal.

          The following cards require a coin flip to pull off the trainer lock, but this drawback can be easily

          Seismitoad-EX and Vikavolt V lock only items with an effect of an attack. This is relatively common 
          and accepted to be a healthy part of the game. The issue with these is that they are big basics, making 
          them extremely difficult to KO if they are item locking you as soon as turn 2. With little to no 
          opportunity to get set up, taking out a big basic can be an impossible task

        <p class="text-content">
          The drawback of Walrein CEC lies both in the fact that the card is a stage 2 as well as the fact that 
          Cold Snap is not able to be used on consecutive turns. Both of these can be side-stepped by using 
          attacks that copy the effect of Cold Snap, such as the one on Slowking SCR. This way the attack being 
          used is the copying attack (Seek Inspiration in this example) and not Cold Snap.

          Houndoom UF started out as legal until eventually being banned in August 2023. Passive Trainer lock 
          (excluding supporters) was eventually found to simply be too strong of an effect for a Stage 1, even 
          with the caveats that Houndoom has. It saw particularly scary results in Banette ex.

          Gengar & Mimikyu-GX is slightly different than the rest of the cards in this category since it's 
          locking attack can only be used once per game. It is not banned only for this attack, but also for being 
          a high hp basic and having a very strong Poltergeist attack as well. Due to being a basic, this card 
          simply allows a player to pull too far ahead too quickly.

          Windstorm or Faba are common Garbodor counters, there are no such common counters for Muk.

      <h2 id="hand-lock">Hand Lock</h2>
      <p>
        Another way to lock an opponent out of the game is by ensuring that they have no playable cards in hand. 
        The following cards are banned on the basis of making this strategy far too easy to pull off.
      </p>

      <h3 id="hand-size-reduction">Hand Size Reduction</h3>
      <p>
        These cards force the opponent to reduce the size of thier hand. These are banned
        in part because they enable a complete hand lock when used in conjunction with other cards that further remove
        cards from the hand. They can also be used on their own to significanly reduce the number of cards a player has 
        in hand, sometimes as soon as turn 1. This makes it extremely difficult to do anything, and allows the opponent 
        to pull too far ahead. Some cards here are also banned due to having supporter-level effects on an item.

          Ghetsis can't be used on the first turn, but it is a 1 sided effect and even provides the player with

      <h3 id="top-deck-manipulation">Top Deck Manipulation</h3>

        The following cards are banned due to their effects allowing a player to manipulate what card the opponent 
        draws at the beginning of their turn. Often used in combination with cards that reduce a player's hand size, 
        they can be used to effectively lock a player out of the game, ensuring that there won't even be a lucky top 
        deck to save them.

        Stronger effects in this game are typically given to cards that have some drawback. A very common drawback
         is being an evolution Pokemon, thus not being able to enter play until turn 2 at the very earliest. There 
         are some cards whose purpose is to circumvent this drawback and bring evolution Pokemon into play with ease. 
         The vast majority of these cards are deemed too strong and are found in this category of bans.

          Eevee SSP got its ban more recently than most other cards on this list due to none of the evolution 
          immediately standing out as being overwhelmingly strong. The combo that was found was to use this Eevee 
          along with any one of three of the Eeveelutions with the “Undevelop” power. Then, using Po Town, you 
          would be able to evolve and devolve at will, knocking yourself out and forcing the opponent to take prize 
          cards, then allowing the use of Roxanne. From there it is possible to hand lock the opponent out of the game 
          as early as turn 1.

          Giovanni is another card that was banned very late, due to there being no obvious targets for the effect. 
          The issue comes though in the persistence of the effect. Rulings suggest that the effect remains on a Pokemon 
          even after it evolves or devolves. The way to break the effect is then to use it on a Giovanni's Pokemon, 
          Ninja Boy and turn it into something else, then continually devolve and evolve to abuse an ability that triggers 
          on evolution (namely Shiftry NXD).

        These cards are characterized not necessarily by their power, but by their difficulty of play in this format. 
        Many early cards in particular had effects that were poorly defined or had unintuitive rulings even within their own formats, 
        and once you release that effect into a card pool with nearly every other card ever printed, rulings get even more messy 
        and it has been decided that these cards are more work than it is worth to play correctly. Some of these cards also 
        have a spiritual successor that was printed later on, giving them even less reason to exist in this format.

          These cards were all banned due to a mistranslation. The phrase “and anything else required to use that 
          attack” was not in the original Japanese, but opens up a world of difficulty in deciding what that actually 
          means. In any case, with that phrase, these cards are also very powerful.

        Cards in this category of bans have effects that knock out the user. In standard formats this is often a 
        huge drawback, putting the opponent one step closer to their win condition of taking six prize cards. 
        This means that any of these effects are created to be very strong, making up for this large drawback. 
        The issue is that  in the Eternal format, there are many cards that are only allowed to be played when a 
        player is behind in the prize race, nullifying much of the drawback of these cards. Also, in the Eternal 
        card pool, there are often many stronger ways to take advantage of the strong effects of these cards than 
        what the original intention of the card in its standard format was.

        Eternal offers a plethora of options when it comes to choosing cards that will help a deck run smoothly,

        Keep in mind that the old “TRAINER” cards seen here are treated as Items, often allowing Supporter levels

          These cards all allow a player to use multiple Supporter cards in a single turn. This has been found
          to be too strong for consistency reasons, but also allows the use of a Supporter that does aid in consistency,
          and another that has some other effect, which is incredibly strong.

        The game is balanced around the idea that cards in the discard pile will generally stay there. 
        Of course recovery from discard is a commonplace effect, but the cards below either have recovery effects 
        that are far too strong, or completely mess with the discard pile in some way. Some of these cards could 
        also be considered “Over-Tuned Consistency” as well.

      <h2 id="scoop-up-effects">Scoop Up Effects</h2>
      <p>
        The following cards return a Pokemon to the player's hand. This effect is fine when it is on a supporter 
        and does not also return the attached cards to a player's hand, but is far too strong when the effect is 
        on an item (or stadium in the case of Narrow Gym) and/or does return all cards attached as well. This is 
        because there are plenty of Pokemon with effects that occur when they enter play, and being able to reuse 
        them with nearly no downside is far too strong. In the case of the supporters, these can often be used with 
        a bulky wall, forcing a win if they opponent is unable to OHKO.

          Lost World was balanced in the era it was from, but over time, there have been too many more ways to put 
          opponent's Pokemon in the lost zone, making pulling off a win with this card very easy.

      <div class="figure-with-text">
        <p class="text-content">
          One potential way to achieve a win with this card is through the use of Gapejaw Bog combined with any 
          Pokemon that can be attached as a tool to another Pokemon from the bench (eg. Unown Q) and them moving 
          damage and repeating this effect with Alakazam BS and Weavile STS.

          Because this format simply has a lot of cards that let you draw, pulling off a 35 card had and winning 
          the game with Unown's ability is relatively easy.

          This Kecleon was briefly legal in the format, but quickly found to be overpowered when used with 
          Sylveon VMAX, or now there would also be the option of using a single prizer, Toxtricity OBF. 
          There is also now the option to abuse this card with Radiant Eevee.

          When used in combination with cards that give a player unlimited amounts of energy acceleration, 
          it allows unlimited and repeated use of effects that occur when an energy is attached from hand.

          Used in conjunction with a card that gives a player unlimited amounts of energy acceleration, 
          Shuckle converts that acceleration to draw power, which becomes especially overpowered with cards 
          like Energy Reset.
